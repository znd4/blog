# Setting up Hugo

I could publish this on a blogging platform or github pages, but Hugo's sounded exciting since I heard about it, and I've wanted to actually put something at `znd4.dev`, so here I am.

Most of this first day has ended up being a huge detour from actual alignment learning, so I might not actually end up posting this until later.

I should probably write a self-reflective post on my challenges with getting stuck in rabbit holes.

## Concerns

I'm a bit worried that I'll fall into a perfectionist trap and spend days editing blog posts that are just meant to be short, rough summaries of my thoughts on what I'm reading that day.

## Motivation

While reading [Rohin Shah's advice](https://rohinshah.com/faq-career-advice-for-ai-alignment-researchers/) on breaking into AI Alignment, something specific jumped out at me:

> ...if youâ€™re going to bother reading an article carefully, you should probably summarize it.

## near-term plans

I'm almost done with week 1 of AGISF, so if I want to make this generally useful for someone in the future, I'll probably need to start by summarizing _some_ of what I've already covered.

I'll probably skip most of week 0, since I didn't cover it in much detail (I'd already learned everything before RL, albeit years ago). With that in mind, I'll probably write a _very_ rough summary of the Reinforcement Learning parts of week 0, followed by my attempt to reiterate the introduction to Ngo's [AGI safety from first principles](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/mzgtmmTKKn5MuCzFJ/p/8xRSjC76HasLnMGSf).

From there, I'll probably attempt to tackle one of the SERI MATS problem sets. Mesa-optimization and inner alignment seems like the likeliest contender, thanks to how interesting it seems, although I'm a bit concerned by how inscrutable (?) it seems compared to some of the problems with outer alignment.
