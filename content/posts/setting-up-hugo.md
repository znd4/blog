# Setting up Hugo

Based on some of [Rohin Shah's advice](https://rohinshah.com/faq-career-advice-for-ai-alignment-researchers/) on breaking into AI Alignment, I've decided to start trying to write up / summarize the things I'm reading, and setting up a blog seems like a decent tool for that.

I could publish this on a blogging platform or github pages, but Hugo's sounded exciting since I heard about it, and I've wanted to actually put something at `znd4.dev`, so here I am.

Most of this first day has ended up being a huge detour from actual alignment learning, so I might not actually end up posting this until later.

I should probably write a self-reflective post on my challenges with getting stuck in rabbit holes.
