## Motivation

While reading [Rohin Shah's advice](https://rohinshah.com/faq-career-advice-for-ai-alignment-researchers/) on breaking into AI Alignment, something specific jumped out at me:

> ...if youâ€™re going to bother reading an article carefully, you should probably summarize it.

## Setting up Hugo

I could publish this on a blogging platform or github pages, but Hugo's sounded exciting since I heard about it, and I've wanted to actually put something at `znd4.dev`, so here I am.

Most of this first day has ended up being a huge detour from actual alignment learning, so I might not actually end up posting this until later.

I should probably write a self-reflective post on my challenges with getting stuck in rabbit holes.

## Concerns

I'm a bit worried that I'll fall into a perfectionist trap and spend days editing blog posts that are just meant to be short, rough summaries of my thoughts on what I'm reading that day.

## near-term plans

I'm almost done with week 1 of AGISF, so if I want to make this generally useful for someone in the future, I'll probably need to start by summarizing _some_ of what I've already covered.

I'll probably skip most of week 0, since I didn't cover it in much detail (I'd already learned everything before RL, albeit years ago). With that in mind, I'll probably write a _very_ rough summary of the Reinforcement Learning parts of week 0, followed by my attempt to reiterate the introduction to Ngo's [AGI safety from first principles](https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/mzgtmmTKKn5MuCzFJ/p/8xRSjC76HasLnMGSf).

### Cracking the Coding Interview / Deep Learning Curriculum

I'm running up against the limitations of not having hands-on experience with training anything more complicated than three-hidden-layer feedforward networks, or a strong academic computer science background. With that in mind, it's probably not in my best interest at the moment to spend too much time thinking about the SERI MATS problems. Instead, I'm going to focus on working through [deep_learning_curriculum](https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum/) and
